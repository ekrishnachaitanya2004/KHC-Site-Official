# Krypto Hashers Community (KHC)

Welcome to the Krypto Hashers Community — a freeform collective of developers, creators, digital explorers, and late-night builders who aren't waiting for permission to make things.

## About Us

We're not a startup, not a bootcamp, and definitely not a LinkedIn productivity cult. We're the in-between space — where someone's building an AI tool that yells motivational quotes every time your tests fail, someone else is making an unnecessarily complex CLI for ordering pizza, and others are deep in GitHub threads fixing bugs, shipping features, and laughing through the chaos.

## What We Do

- Build cool, useful, hilarious, or totally absurd things just because we can
- Host live code jams and weekend build sprints
- Run chill seshes where we co-work, brainstorm, or just vibe
- Fix bugs at 2AM with way too many browser tabs open
- Turn chaos into open-source innovation

## Join Us

If you've ever:
- Had a half-baked idea you wanted to bring to life
- Stayed up all night debugging something stupid
- Wished you had people to just vibe with and learn from
- Wanted a crew that hypes you up for shipping something strange and brilliant

Then you're home. Welcome to KHC.
